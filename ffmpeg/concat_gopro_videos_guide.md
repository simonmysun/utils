- run `probe_stream.sh` first. This generates `files.txt` and `ffprobe.txt`
- view `probe_stream.sh` to check the resolution and framerate (`cat ffprobe.txt | grep Video`)
- run `genlist.sh` to generate `concat.txt`
- edit `concat.txt` to adjust order and pick what to concat
- run `concat.sh`
- repeat until all video are done
- remove `concat.txt`
